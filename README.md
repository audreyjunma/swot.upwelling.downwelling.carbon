# Studying Geostrophic Events in the Southern Ocean with SWOT Data: Analyzing Upwelling and Downwelling events influenced by the Ekman Transport to Observe Impacts on Carbon Uptake
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code necessary to recreate all of my figures and work for my study on how geostrophic events like upwelling and downwelling, particularly those influenced by the Ekman Transport, impact carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean. This project was mentored by the Dr. Andrew Thompson, director of Caltech's Linde and Maxine Center for Global Environmental Science, and it was completed in 2024.

# Installation Requirements
1. Authentification for earthaccess database or access to downloadable SWOT Data Files
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Relevant Python Libraries (see notebook)

# Usage Examples
This notebook was initially created in an internship at Caltech's Linde and Maxine Center for Global Environmental Science.
