# Studying Geostrophic Events in the Southern Ocean with SWOT Data: Analyzing Upwelling and Downwelling events influenced by the Ekman Transport to Observe Impacts on Carbon Uptake

This Jupyter Notebook contains the code necessary to recreate all of my figures and work for my study on how geostrophic events like upwelling and downwelling, particularly those influenced by the Ekman Transport, impact carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean. This project was mentored by the Dr. Andrew Thompson, director of Caltech's Linde and Maxine Center for Global Environmental Science, and it was completed in 2024.

## Background Information
The Southern Ocean is a major carbon sink, accounting for approximately 40% of the ocean's global uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Upwelling is the process of cold, nutrient-rich water rising from deep into the ocean to the surface, whereas downwelling is the process of surface water moving downward. Both contribute to carbon uptake, as downwelling sequesters carbon rich surface water deeper into the ocean, while upwelling pushes the nutrients necessary for organisms like phytoplankton to perform photosythesis and further sequester carbon. The Ekman transport, a fundamental physical driver of ocean circulation is a primary cause for wind induced upwelling and downwelling in many coastal areas, and facilitates both the biological and physical processes responsible for moving and storing carbon within the ocean system.

## Installation Requirements
